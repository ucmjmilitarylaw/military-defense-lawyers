## 1\. What Is a Military Separation Board?

A [separation board is an administrative](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/boards/ "Administrative Separation Boards") hearing where a panel of officers evaluates whether a service member should be involuntarily discharged. The board reviews evidence, hears witnesses, and ultimately recommends:

- Whether misconduct or substandard performance occurred
- Whether retention or discharge is warranted
- The characterization of discharge (Honorable, General, or Other Than Honorable)

Unlike a court-martial, separation boards are not criminal trialsâ€”but the consequences can be equally damaging.

## 2\. What Triggers a Separation Board?

Common triggers include:

- **Misconduct:** Article 15s, civilian criminal convictions, UCMJ violations (e.g., Article 120, 128, 92)
- **Substandard Duty Performance:** Failing PT tests, poor evaluations, dereliction of duty
- **Drug Abuse:** Positive urinalysis or substantiated drug-related misconduct
- **Loss of Security Clearance:** Especially for jobs requiring Top Secret access
- **Pattern of Minor Infractions:** Repeated NJPs, counseling statements, or Article 15s
- **Personality Disorders or Medical Conditions:** Can trigger medical separation boards or administrative boards depending on context
- **Commission of a Serious Offense:** Even without court-martial, serious misconduct (e.g., sexual assault, theft) may result in separation board action
- **Other Basis:** Failure to meet body composition standards, pregnancy discharge in some branches, conscientious objector status

## 3\. Types of Boards

- **Enlisted:** Called an Administrative Separation Board (AdSep Board)
- **Officer:** Called a Board of Inquiry (BOI)

Each branch uses slightly different terminology and procedures, but the core functions are the same: evaluate the evidence, determine if the member should stay or go, and assign a discharge type.

## 4\. Your Rights at a Separation Board

If youâ€™ve served 6+ years or are facing an Other Than Honorable (OTH) discharge, youâ€™re entitled to:

- A written notice of the reason for the board
- Time to prepare a defense
- The right to be represented by military and/or civilian defense counsel
- The right to call witnesses and present evidence
- The right to cross-examine government witnesses
- A verbatim transcript of the proceedings

**Pro Tip:** Even if you have less than 6 years in service, you may request a board if an OTH discharge is possible.

## 5\. Consequences of a Separation Board Decision

The boardâ€™s recommendation affects:

- Whether youâ€™re retained or discharged
- The discharge type (Honorable, General, OTH)
- Future VA benefits, education benefits, retirement eligibility
- Reenlistment codes and job opportunities post-service
- Whether your discharge triggers mandatory registration (e.g., sex offender registry)

An **Other Than Honorable discharge** can destroy your reputation, cost you VA benefits, and follow you into civilian life.

## 6\. How to Defend Against a Separation Board

Common defense strategies include:

- **Challenge the evidence:** Show that the misconduct did not occur or was exaggerated
- **Prove procedural errors:** Violations of due process, notice, or evidence rules
- **Good military character:** Awards, evals, deployments, leadership endorsements
- **Witness testimony:** From chain of command, peers, family, or character witnesses
- **Rehabilitation potential:** Show that youâ€™ve corrected behavior and should be retained
- **Civilian counsel:** Experienced lawyers often present stronger, more aggressive defenses than JAG attorneys who may be overloaded with cases

Enlisted members can sometimes request a discharge in lieu of a board, but outcomes vary by case and branch.
