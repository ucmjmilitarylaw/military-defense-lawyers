# Military Legal Guide for Service Members Stationed at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland

**If you’re stationed at Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG) and facing a legal issue under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), this guide is for you.** Whether you’re dealing with an Article 15, administrative separation, a GOMOR, or are under investigation, understanding your rights is critical. This comprehensive legal guide will walk you through your options, the base history, local legal climate, and how to get the help you need.

## About Aberdeen Proving Ground

Aberdeen Proving Ground, located in Harford County, Maryland, was established in 1917 to test military equipment for the U.S. Army during World War I. Today, it’s one of the most important research and development installations in the Army, with nearly 3,000 military personnel and over 20,000 civilian contractors and employees.

APG houses several commands and organizations, including:

- U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command (DEVCOM)
- Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC)
- Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense
- Aberdeen Test Center

Its strategic proximity to Washington, D.C. and Baltimore gives it a unique role in military logistics, intelligence, and biomedical research.

## The Local Area

The surrounding region includes the towns of Aberdeen, Havre de Grace, and Edgewood. Harford County is known for its small-town charm, local [law enforcement cooperation with military](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/military-bases/florida-military-law/ "Military Law & UCMJ Defense Lawyers in Florida") authorities, and an increasing number of off-base civilian prosecutions involving active-duty personnel. The legal climate here is pro-military, but that doesn’t mean [service members](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/military-attorneys/ "Top Military Attorneys: Expert Legal Support for Service Members and Veterans") are immune from serious punishment.

## Understanding UCMJ and Common Legal Threats at APG

The [UCMJ governs every aspect of military justice](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/ucmj/what-is-the-ucmj/ "What is the UCMJ?"). Whether you’re [accused of misconduct](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/ucmj/article-134/ "Article 134 UCMJ – The General Article") on or off post, the consequences can be career-ending. At APG, we’ve seen [soldiers face disciplinary actions](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/false-sharp-complaint-army/ "Navigating False Sharp Complaints in the Army: Understanding Your Rights and Responsibilities") ranging from minor infractions to felony-level charges. The most common UCMJ issues include:

- **Article 120 – Sexual** [Assault and Sexual Misconduct: Allegations](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/alse-sharp-complaint-army/ "Understanding the Alse Sharp Complaint in the Army: A Comprehensive Guide") often stem from off-post relationships or post-party accusations. These [cases move quickly and often involve CID](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/investigations/ "Military Investigations: Your Guide to CID, NCIS, OSI, CGIS Investigations") or local police.
- **[Article 128b –](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/ucmj/article-120/ "Article 120 – Sex Offense Allegations") Domestic Violence:** APG sees many domestic violence accusations involving dual military couples or military-civilian relationships.
- **[Article 92 –](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/ucmj/article-120/ "Article 120 – Sex Offense Allegations") Failure to Obey Orders:** This includes everything from violating no-contact orders to unauthorized social media posts.
- **[Article 107 –](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/ucmj/article-118/ "Article 118 UCMJ – Murder and Homicide Charges in the Military") False Official Statements:** Often tacked on to other charges, especially during investigations.

If you’re being questioned by law enforcement, command, or investigators, do **not** speak without first contacting an experienced [civilian military defense attorney](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/start-here/ "Are You Under Military Investigation or Facing Discharge?"). Statements made early in the process are often used against you, even when you’re trying to be helpful or cooperative.

## Administrative Actions: More Common Than You Think

Not every adverse [action at APG involves a court-martial](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/ucmj/timeline-of-a-ucmj-case-from-incident-to-resolution/ "Timeline of a UCMJ Case: From Incident to Resolution"). In fact, many soldiers find themselves facing career-ending [consequences from administrative](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/boards/separation-board-survival/ "How to Survive a Separation Board") actions, including:

- **Article 15 (Non-Judicial Punishment):** Many soldiers don’t realize they have the right to turn down an Article 15 and demand a [trial by court-martial](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/ucmj-military-justice-101/ "UCMJ Military Justice 101"). This can be a strategic move in many cases.
- [**General Officer Memorandum of Reprimand (GOMOR):** A GOMOR](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/gomor/ "What is a GOMOR and How to Fight It: Your Career Demands Aggressive Defense") can be filed locally or in your permanent file. A well-crafted rebuttal is often the only way to avoid long-term damage.
- **Administrative Separation:** Soldiers flagged for separation often have the right to a board (if eligible). These boards determine whether you receive an Honorable, General, or Other Than Honorable discharge.
- **Command-Directed Investigations:** Although they are administrative, CDIs can lead to severe disciplinary outcomes, including [security clearance revocation](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/ucmj-military-justice-101/ "UCMJ Military Justice 101") and adverse actions.

## Base Legal vs. Civilian Military Lawyers

The APG Staff Judge Advocate’s office provides limited legal assistance. They cannot represent you in court-martial, [separation boards, or contested Article 15 hearings](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/boards/ "Administrative Separation Boards – Boards of Inquiry (BOI) and Enlisted Elimination"). They also cannot provide truly independent [legal advice if the command](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/ucmj/common-myths-mistakes-about-military-justice/ "Common Myths & Mistakes About Military Justice") is taking action against you.

**[Civilian military defense lawyers](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/military-defense-lawyers/do-i-need-a-military-defense-lawyer-near-me/ "Do I Need a Military Defense Lawyer Near Me?")** offer confidentiality, aggressive representation, and decades of experience handling UCMJ cases at bases like Aberdeen. If you’re facing serious consequences, [hiring a civilian attorney](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/investigations/ "Military Investigations: Your Guide to CID, NCIS, OSI, CGIS Investigations") is often your best chance of protecting your career.

## Download the UCMJ Survival Guide

If you or a loved one are under investigation or facing military discipline, download the [UCMJ Survival Guide](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FCDD3B2Z). It was written by Michael and Alexandra Waddington, two of the most [experienced military defense attorneys](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/best-court-martial-lawyer/ "Top Tips for Finding the Best Court Martial Lawyer for Your Defense") in the country. This [guide breaks down the entire legal process](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/investigations/ "Military Investigations: Your Guide to CID, NCIS, OSI, CGIS Investigations") and gives you a strategic plan to fight back.
