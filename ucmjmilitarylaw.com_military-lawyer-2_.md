### Navigating the UCMJ: Key Differences from Civilian Law

Navigating the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) requires a distinct understanding compared to civilian law.

The UCMJ governs all members of the armed forces and incorporates military-specific offenses that do not exist in civilian law, such as desertion and insubordination.

This military legal framework holds service members accountable for their conduct both in and out of uniform, emphasizing discipline and order.

Military lawyers, or Judge Advocates (JAGs), are crucial in advising personnel about these laws, ensuring fair representation during court martials, and navigating the appeals process.

Understanding the rigorous standards and expedited procedures under the UCMJ is essential for any [military](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/military-bases/andrews-afb-maryland/ "Andrews AFB Maryland Military Law & UCMJ Legal Guide") member facing legal challenges.
