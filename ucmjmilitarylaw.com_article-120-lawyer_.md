### Key Differences Between Civil and Military Proceedings

\## Key Differences Between Civil and Military Proceedings

Navigating civil and military legal systems demands an understanding of their fundamental differences.

Civil proceedings often adhere to federal and state laws, focusing on the adjudication of rights and liabilities among individuals or entities.

In contrast, military proceedings are governed by the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), prioritizing discipline and order within the armed forces.

For instance, in military courts, cases can address offenses unique to military service members, such as Article 120 violations, which pertain to sexual assault and related offenses.

Moreover, the procedural rules diverge; civil cases typically involve jury trials, while military cases may or may not have juries, depending on the severity of the charge.

Civil courts aim for a preponderance of evidence, whereas military courts utilize a higher standard known as beyond a reasonable doubt for serious charges.

Understanding these distinctions is vital for service members seeking representation—especially from an Article 120 lawyer—who can provide specialized defense strategies tailored to military law.

For those looking to engage with the military justice system, this knowledge serves as a crucial first step.

### Common Defenses an Article 120 Lawyer May Use

As an Article 120 lawyer, you can leverage several common defenses when representing military clients accused of sexual misconduct under this statute.

One primary defense is that of consent, which asserts that the alleged victim agreed to the sexual activity in question.

For example, if the defense can provide compelling evidence that consent was given, it may lead to a favorable verdict.

Another common defense is the argument of mistaken belief in consent, where the accused asserts they believed the other party consented, regardless of the actual circumstances.

Additionally, the defense may question the credibility of the witness, arguing that inconsistencies in their testimony are enough to instill reasonable doubt.

Finally, alibi defenses may be utilized, demonstrating that the accused was not present at the time of the alleged offense.

Each case is unique, and effective defense strategies should be tailored to the specific facts and circumstances involved (Source: UCMJ Article 120).
