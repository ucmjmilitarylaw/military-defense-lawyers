This page is your essential legal survival guide to navigating UCMJ and related disciplinary actions at NSA Bahrain. It includes everything you need to know about your rights, legal services available both on and off post, and how to protect your career.

## A Brief History of NSA Bahrain

## Common Legal Issues for Service Members at NSA Bahrain

### Court-Martial Under the UCMJ

Soldiers at NSA Bahrain face charges under:

- **Article 120** – Sexual Assault
- **Article 128b** – Domestic Violence
- **Article 92** – Failure to Obey
- **Article 133/134** – Misconduct

Do not talk to CID or command without a civilian defense lawyer. Your words will be used against you.

### Article 15 / NJP

Article 15s are often offered for minor misconduct but can derail your career. You may have the option to refuse NJP and request a court-martial. Make this decision carefully—with legal counsel.

### GOMORs

A General Officer Memorandum of Reprimand can be filed locally or permanently. A permanent GOMOR can destroy promotion chances and trigger separation. A well-written rebuttal may save your file—and your future.

### Administrative Separation & Boards

Enlisted soldiers may face a **Chapter Separation** while officers face a **Board of Inquiry (BOI)**. These boards determine your discharge characterization and your access to VA benefits, retirement, and more.

### Command-Directed Investigations (CDI)

Often triggered by SHARP/SAPR complaints, CDIs are administrative—but serious. You have the right to remain silent and the right to hire a civilian lawyer to protect your interests during and after the investigation.

## Legal Services Available at NSA Bahrain

### NSA Bahrain JAG Office

The base legal office provides wills, POAs, and general legal information. They cannot represent you in UCMJ matters, GOMORs, or separations. You need independent defense counsel.

### Civilian Military Defense Lawyers

Civilian attorneys like **Michael and Alexandra Waddington** specialize in court-martials, Article 15 defense, and administrative separation cases at NSA Bahrain and worldwide. They are the authors of the [UCMJ Survival Guide](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FCDD3B2Z), a proven resource for service members and families.
