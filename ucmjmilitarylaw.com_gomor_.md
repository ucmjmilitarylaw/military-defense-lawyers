# What is a GOMOR and How to Fight It: Your Career Demands Aggressive Defense

For service members, receiving a General Officer Memorandum of Reprimand (GOMOR) can feel like a sudden, devastating blow to their military career. Often presented as an administrative formality, a GOMOR is far more than just a letter; it is a serious administrative censure that, if filed permanently in your Official Military Personnel File (OMPF), can effectively end your career, block promotions, and jeopardize your ability to remain in the service. Underestimating its power is a critical mistake.

A GOMOR signifies that a General Officer or General Court-Martial Convening Authority (GCMCA) believes you have engaged in serious misconduct or failed to meet military standards. While it is not a criminal conviction, the implications for your future are severe. This comprehensive guide will explain what a GOMOR is, detail its profound impact, and outline the [aggressive defense strategies](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/court-martial/strategy/ "Court-Martial Defense Strategy") essential to fighting it. When your career hangs in the balance, immediate and expert legal intervention from a firm like Gonzalez & Waddington is not just advisable—it is absolutely essential.

## I. What is a General Officer Memorandum of Reprimand (GOMOR)?

A GOMOR is a formal, written administrative reprimand issued by a General Officer or a General Court-Martial Convening Authority (GCMCA). It serves as an official censure for significant misconduct or substandard performance that, while serious, may not warrant a court-martial. It is a powerful tool commanders use to address behavior deemed inconsistent with military standards and values.

### A. Definition and Purpose

The GOMOR is a formal document that officially records and criticizes a service member’s alleged misconduct. Its purpose is to officially document serious lapses in conduct or performance, deter future misconduct, and ensure appropriate administrative action. It signifies a senior leader’s official disapproval of a service member’s actions.

### B. Common Reasons for Issuance

GOMORs are issued for a wide range of conduct that violates military regulations, policies, or standards of professionalism. These often include:

- Inappropriate Relationships: Such as fraternization, adultery, or other violations of professional boundaries.
- Sexual Harassment or Assault [Allegations](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/ucmj/article-120/ "Article 120 – Sex Offense Allegations"): Even if criminal charges are not pursued or result in an acquittal, a GOMOR can be issued based on an administrative investigation.
- Toxic Leadership or Unprofessional Conduct: Behaviors that create a negative command climate, undermine morale, or display a lack of integrity.
- Financial Misconduct: Improper handling of funds, personal financial mismanagement, or fraud.
- Abuse of Authority: Misuse of power or position for personal gain or to mistreat subordinates.
- Civilian Criminal Charges: Even if a service member is acquitted or charges are dismissed in civilian court, a GOMOR can be issued if the military commander believes the conduct violated [military standards](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/investigations/command-directed/ "Command Investigations (CDI & 15-6)").
- Drug or Alcohol Misconduct: Particularly if it impacts duty performance or reflects poorly on the service.

### C. Standard of Proof

Unlike a court-martial, which requires proof “beyond a reasonable doubt,” a GOMOR is issued based on a “preponderance of the evidence” standard. This means the General Officer or GCMCA must only believe that the alleged misconduct is “more likely than not” (a 51% certainty) to have occurred. This significantly lower standard makes it easier for the command to issue a GOMOR, highlighting why a robust defense is crucial from the outset.

### D. Who Can Receive a GOMOR?

GOMORs can be issued to any service member, from junior enlisted personnel to senior non-commissioned officers, warrant officers, and commissioned officers. However, the impact is often disproportionately severe for officers and senior NCOs, who are held to stricter standards of conduct and whose careers are more susceptible to negative administrative actions.

## II. The Devastating Impact of a GOMOR: Why You Must Fight It

The true danger of a GOMOR lies not just in the letter itself, but in where it is filed. The decision to file it locally versus permanently in your Official Military Personnel File (OMPF) can be the difference between a minor setback and a career-ending event.

### A. Local File vs. Official Military Personnel File (OMPF) Filing

- Local File (Temporary): If a GOMOR is filed only in your local unit file (sometimes called a Military Personnel Record Jacket), its impact is generally limited. These GOMORs are typically destroyed after three years or upon a Permanent Change of Station (PCS). They are usually not seen by promotion boards and have minimal long-term career implications.
- Official Military Personnel File (OMPF) Filing (Permanent): This is the devastating outcome. If a GOMOR is filed in your OMPF, it becomes a permanent part of your official military record. This means:
  - It will be viewed by every promotion board, selection board (for schools, special assignments), and Human Resources Command (HRC).
  - It will remain in your OMPF for the remainder of your career unless successfully removed through an appeal process.
  - This type of filing almost invariably leads to severe career consequences.

### B. Career-Ending Consequences of OMPF Filing

An OMPF-filed GOMOR is a red flag that can derail even the most promising military careers:

- Denial of Promotion: This is perhaps the most immediate and common consequence. Promotion boards heavily scrutinize OMPF contents, and a GOMOR signals serious concerns about your judgment, leadership, or integrity, making promotion virtually impossible.
- Denial of Re-enlistment or Forced Separation: A GOMOR can lead to an unfavorable re-enlistment code, denying you the opportunity to continue your service. It can also be a direct basis for involuntary administrative separation, especially if you are high year tenured or otherwise flagged for separation.
- Loss of Desirable Assignments and Schools: You will likely be disqualified from leadership positions, specialized schools, prestigious assignments, and other career-enhancing opportunities.
- Negative Evaluation Reports: The misconduct leading to a GOMOR will often result in a “referred” Officer Evaluation Report (OER) or NCO Evaluation Report (NCOER), further damaging your career trajectory.
- Security Clearance Review/Revocation: A GOMOR, particularly for misconduct involving trustworthiness or judgment, can trigger a security clearance review, leading to suspension or even revocation, which can end careers in sensitive roles.
- Preclusion from Retirement: In some cases, a GOMOR can precipitate administrative separation before a service member becomes eligible for full retirement benefits, costing them years of service and financial security.

### C. Social and Professional Stigma

Beyond the formal impacts, an OMPF-filed GOMOR can carry a significant social and professional stigma within the [military](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/ucmj/the-profound-impact-of-military-justice-outcomes/ "The Profound Impact of Military Justice Outcomes") community, affecting peer perception and future opportunities within and outside of service.

## III. How to Fight a GOMOR: Your Aggressive Defense Strategy

Fighting a GOMOR is not optional; it is imperative. The initial response window is narrow, demanding immediate and aggressive action. A robust defense can prevent OMPF filing, or even lead to the withdrawal of the GOMOR altogether.

### A. Immediate Action is Critical

The moment you are notified of a potential GOMOR is the most critical time to act. You typically have a very short window (often 7 calendar days in the Army) to submit your formal response. Do NOT delay:

- Do NOT Sign to Agree: You will be asked to sign to acknowledge receipt. This merely confirms you received it; it does NOT mean you agree with the allegations. Sign only to acknowledge receipt.
- Do NOT Attempt to Explain or Defend Yourself without Counsel: Your initial impulse might be to talk to your commander or the issuing authority. Resist this urge. Any informal explanations can be misinterpreted or used against you.
- Seek Legal Counsel [Immediately: Contact a civilian military](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/start-here/military-investigations-defense-actions-to-take-immediately/ "Military Investigations: Defense Actions to Take Immediately") defense attorney as soon as you receive notification. This is your most crucial first step.

### B. Understanding Your Rights

When facing a GOMOR, you have specific due process rights:

- Right to Submit a Formal Written Rebuttal: This is your primary opportunity to present your side of the story, challenge the allegations, and argue for a favorable filing determination.
- Right to Submit Supporting Documents: You can include any evidence that supports your rebuttal, such as sworn statements, performance evaluations, and character letters.
- Right to Counsel: You have the right to consult with a military or civilian attorney to help you prepare your rebuttal and navigate the process.

### C. Crafting a Powerful Rebuttal: The Heart of Your Defense

Your formal written rebuttal is your strongest weapon. It must be carefully crafted, legally sound, and strategically persuasive. Key elements of a powerful rebuttal include:

- Direct Denial of Allegations: If the allegations are false, directly refute them with credible evidence.
- Rebuttal of Evidence: Challenge the accuracy, credibility, or relevance of the evidence the command is using against you. Highlight inconsistencies, unreliable witness statements, or procedural flaws in the investigation that led to the GOMOR.
- Procedural Errors: Meticulously examine whether the command followed all applicable regulations in issuing the GOMOR. Any significant procedural error can be grounds for removal.
- Explanation or Context: If the events occurred, provide context without necessarily admitting wrongdoing. Explain the circumstances that led to the incident, demonstrating that the misconduct was not indicative of your true character or performance.
- Mitigation: This is a crucial component. Even if some facts are accepted, argue that the GOMOR should not be filed in your OMPF or should be withdrawn due to compelling mitigating factors. This can include:
  - Exemplary Service History: Detail your awards, decorations, positive performance evaluations (OERs/NCOERs), and overall contributions to the military.
  - Character Statements: Secure powerful, positive character statements from current and former supervisors, peers, and subordinates who can attest to your professionalism and integrity.
  - Impact of Underlying Issues: Present evidence that factors like combat stress, deployments, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), or Military Sexual Trauma (MST) may have contributed to or explained the alleged misconduct.
  - Rehabilitation Efforts: Document any steps you have taken to address the underlying issues, such as seeking counseling, attending training, or demonstrating a commitment to improvement.
  - Lack of Prior Discipline: Emphasize a clean disciplinary record if applicable.
- Explicit Request for Local Filing/Withdrawal: Clearly state your request that the GOMOR either be withdrawn entirely or, at a minimum, filed only in your local file and not your OMPF.

### D. Gathering Essential Evidence

To support your rebuttal, you will need to gather all relevant documents and evidence, which may include:

- All related investigative reports (e.g., AR 15-6, CID/NCIS/OSI reports, SHARP/EO investigations).
- Police reports or court judgments related to any civilian incidents.
- Your official performance evaluations (OERs/NCOERs) and awards.
- Sworn statements from witnesses who can support your version of events or attest to your character.
- Letters of support from leaders, peers, and community members.
- Medical records, if relevant to a mental health or physical condition defense.

### E. Implications for Criminal Cases

If the misconduct leading to the GOMOR is also subject to a criminal investigation or court-martial, your GOMOR rebuttal must be carefully coordinated with your criminal defense strategy. Statements made in a GOMOR rebuttal can potentially be used in a criminal prosecution, making legal strategy paramount.

## IV. Post-Rebuttal Strategies: Appealing and Removing a GOMOR

If your GOMOR is filed in your OMPF despite your rebuttal, the fight is not over. There are further avenues for appeal and removal, though they require a strong legal case and persistence.

### A. The Adjudication Decision

After reviewing your rebuttal, the General Officer or GCMCA will make a final decision on whether the GOMOR will be filed locally or in your OMPF. This decision will be communicated to you in writing.

### B. Appealing an OMPF-Filed GOMOR

- Service-Specific Appeals Boards: Each service typically has its own administrative appeals process for OMPF-filed GOMORs. For example, in the Army, appeals are submitted to the Department of the Army Suitability Evaluation Board (DASEB). You must demonstrate that the GOMOR was unjust, erroneous, or should be removed for equitable reasons.
- Boards for Correction of Military Records (BCMRs): These are the highest-level administrative review boards within the military (e.g., Army Board for Correction of Military Records – ABCMR). If your initial appeal (like DASEB) is denied, or if you are in a service without a specific GOMOR appeals board, you can petition the BCMR. The BCMR has the authority to correct any military record to correct an “error or injustice.” This is a more complex appeal process and often requires a higher standard of proof.

### C. Criteria for Successful Appeal/Removal

To successfully appeal or remove an OMPF-filed GOMOR, you generally need to demonstrate:

- Factual Error: That the allegations against you were factually incorrect or based on insufficient evidence.
- Procedural Injustice: That the command failed to follow proper regulatory procedures in issuing the GOMOR, denying you due process.
- Inequity: That the GOMOR, or its permanent filing, is unjust given your overall service record, mitigating factors, and demonstrated rehabilitation. This is often where compelling character evidence and proof of underlying issues (like PTSD/TBI) can be most effective.
