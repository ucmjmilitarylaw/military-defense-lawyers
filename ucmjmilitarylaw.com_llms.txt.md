Navigating Military Law in Georgia: Your Comprehensive Guide to UCMJ, Courts-Martial, and Legal Defense I. Introduction: Understanding Military Justice in Georgia The military justice system operates under a distinct legal framework, fundamentally separate from civilian courts. This distinction arises from the unique requirements of maintaining "good order and discipline" within the armed forces, which are paramount for effective operations and national security. This comprehensive guide aims to illuminate the intricacies of military law for service members, their families, and other interested parties stationed in or connected to Georgia. It provides a detailed overview of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), the courts-martial process, and the various legal resources available within the state, encompassing both official military channels and independent civilian defense counsel. By understanding these critical aspects, individuals can be better equipped to navigate the complexities of military legal challenges. II. The Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ): Foundations of Military Law The Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) stands as the foundational legal document governing all members of the United States military, establishing a comprehensive set of criminal laws applicable worldwide. A. What is the UCMJ? The UCMJ was enacted by Congress and signed into law by President Harry S. Truman on May 5, 1950, marking a pivotal shift in military jurisprudence. Prior to its establishment, military personnel were subject to disparate regulations, such as the Articles of War, which often led to inconsistencies and perceived unfairness in the administration of justice. The creation of the UCMJ was a direct response to this need for a more standardized and equitable system across all branches of the armed forces.

The UCMJ's authority extends to a broad spectrum of individuals, including...

Comprehensive Guide to Air Force Boards of Inquiry for Officers I. Introduction: Understanding the Air Force Board of Inquiry (BOI) A. Definition and Purpose of a Board of Inquiry A Board of Inquiry (BOI) represents a formal administrative proceeding within the United States Air Force designed to scrutinize allegations concerning an officer's personal conduct, professional behavior, or overall performance. The fundamental objective of a BOI is to evaluate an officer's continued suitability for military service and to determine whether retention or separation is warranted. This process is distinct from criminal proceedings; it serves as an administrative evaluation focused exclusively on an officer's future service status rather than the pursuit of criminal penalties. Despite its administrative nature, the outcomes of a BOI can be profoundly severe, potentially leading to mandatory separation from service, forfeiture of earned military benefits, and significant, lasting damage to an officer's professional reputation. The military's unwavering demand for strict adherence to its code of conduct necessitates such a mechanism to maintain the integrity and effectiveness of its officer corps. The administrative character of a BOI presents a unique challenge for officers. While it means the proceedings are not criminal trials, it also implies a lower evidentiary standard and more relaxed rules of evidence compared to criminal court-martials.

This reduced burden of proof means that an officer can face involuntary separation based on evidence that might be insufficient for a criminal conviction, placing a significant onus on the officer to mount a robust defense. This framework allows the military to uphold rigorous standards for its officer corps, prioritizing institutional integrity and operational effectiveness. For the officer, however, this means that even perceived minor infractions or performance...

What is the UCMJ? The Uniform Code of Military Justice is a federal statute, enacted by the United States Congress, that establishes criminal law for military personnel. It applies to all active duty service members, National Guard and Reserve members on active duty orders, cadets and midshipmen, and in some cases, retired service members receiving pay. Unlike civilian law, which varies by state, the UCMJ provides a consistent legal standard across the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, ensuring uniformity in military justice wherever service members are stationed worldwide. The primary purpose of the UCMJ is to maintain good order and discipline within the armed forces, essential for military readiness and the effective execution of missions. It defines specific offenses that are unique to the military (e. g. , Absence Without Leave) as well as those that parallel civilian crimes (e. g. , assault, larceny).

UCMJ vs. Civilian Law: Key Distinctions While both military and civilian justice systems aim to uphold the law, they operate under different principles, jurisdictions, and procedures. Understanding these distinctions is vital for service members navigating legal challenges. Jurisdiction: UCMJ: Applies to military personnel globally, regardless of where the offense occurred (on or off base, in the U. S. or abroad). Civilian Law: Primarily applies to civilians and within specific geographic boundaries (state, federal). Offenses: UCMJ: Includes crimes unique to the military (e. g. , AWOL, disobeying a lawful order, conduct unbecoming an officer) alongside offenses that parallel civilian crimes (e. g. , assault, larceny). Civilian Law: Covers a wide range of crimes applicable to the general populace. Procedural Rules: UCMJ: Governed by the Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM) and Military Rules of Evidence (MRE). Procedures can be more streamlined and swifter than civilian counterparts. Civilian Law: Governed by federal or state rules of criminal procedure and evidence. Judges and Juries (Court Members): UCMJ: Military judges are commissioned officers and lawyers. Juries are replaced by "court members," who are typically officers or senior enlisted personnel, superior in rank to the accused. Civilian Law: Judges are appointed or elected. Juries are typically composed of randomly selected civilians from the community. Sentencing: UCMJ: Sentencing immediately follows a guilty verdict. Punishments include confinement, forfeitures of pay, reduction in rank, and punitive discharges (Bad-Conduct Discharge, Dishonorable Discharge, Dismissal for officers). Civilian Law: Sentencing is often a separate proceeding, sometimes days or weeks after a guilty verdict. Punishments include fines, incarceration, probation, and community service. Appellate Process: UCMJ: Involves military appellate courts (e. g. , Army Court of Criminal Appeals, Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces) before rare appeals to the U. S. Supreme Court. Civilian Law: Involves state or federal appellate courts, potentially leading to...

Types of Military Justice Actions: A Spectrum of Discipline The military justice system employs various tools to address misconduct, ranging from minor administrative actions to severe criminal prosecutions. A. Non-Judicial Punishment (NJP / Article 15 UCMJ) NJP is a commander's tool for addressing minor misconduct without resorting to a court-martial. While less formal, it carries significant consequences. Purpose: Swift, non-judicial discipline for minor offenses. Process: Commander determines guilt and imposes punishment. Service member can usually refuse NJP and demand a court-martial. Punishments: Restriction, extra duties, forfeiture of pay, reduction in rank. Confinement is rare and typically limited to those on a vessel. Impact: Not a federal criminal conviction, but can negatively affect evaluations, promotion, and re-enlistment eligibility. B. Administrative Actions (Non-Punitive Separations) These actions result in involuntary separation from service without a criminal conviction, but still carry profound lifelong impacts. Reasons: Misconduct (e. g. , drug use, pattern of minor offenses), unsatisfactory performance, medical conditions, or for the convenience of the government. Process: Involves formal notification, the service member's right to submit a written rebuttal, and often an Administrative Separation Board (ASB) or Board of Inquiry (BOI) hearing, where the government must prove its case by a "preponderance of the evidence" (more likely than not). Discharge Characterization: Can result in an Honorable, General (Under Honorable Conditions), or Other Than Honorable (OTH) discharge. Impact: Loss of VA benefits (especially GI Bill for General/OTH), significant employment challenges, and security clearance issues. C. Courts-Martial (Criminal Trials) The military's formal criminal justice system, leading to federal criminal convictions and potentially severe punishments. Summary Court-Martial (SCM): For minor offenses, limited to enlisted personnel. A single officer presides. Limited punishments. Special Court-Martial (SPCM): Misdemeanor-level. Military judge and at least three members. Can adjudge a Bad-Conduct Discharge (BCD) and up to one year of confinement. General Court-Martial...

Articles of the UCMJ: Offenses at a Glance The UCMJ contains specific articles defining various offenses, from minor infractions to serious felonies. Each article has defined elements that the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt for a conviction. Article 86 (Absence Without Leave - AWOL / Desertion): Unexcused absence from duty, unit, or place of duty. Desertion implies intent to permanently remain away. Article 92 (Failure to Obey Order or Regulation / Dereliction of Duty): Violating a lawful order or regulation, or negligently or willfully failing to perform duties. Article 112a (Wrongful Use, Possession, etc. , of Controlled Substances): Covers drug offenses, including wrongful use, possession, introduction, manufacture, and distribution of controlled substances. Article 120 (Rape and Sexual Assault): Defines offenses involving sexual acts committed without consent, by force, threat, or when the victim is incapacitated. Also covers aggravated and abusive sexual contact. Article 121 (Larceny and Wrongful Appropriation): Theft of money or property with intent to permanently deprive (Larceny) or temporarily deprive (Wrongful Appropriation). Article 133 (Conduct Unbecoming an Officer and a Gentleman): For officers, conduct that dishonors or discredits the officer's professional and ethical obligations, even if not explicitly covered by other articles. Article 134 (General Article): A broad "catch-all" article that covers any conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline, or conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces, or non-capital crimes not specifically covered by other UCMJ articles. Examples include adultery, communicating a threat, reckless endangerment, and false statements.

Timeline of a UCMJ Case: From Incident to Resolution Understanding the chronological progression of a UCMJ case helps service members know what to expect and when to act. Incident/Allegation: Misconduct or alleged offense occurs and is reported. Initial Investigation: Chain of command or criminal investigative agencies (CID, NCIS, OSI) gather facts. Service member should invoke Article 31b rights if suspected. Commander's Decision/Disposition: Commander decides whether to take no action, issue non-punitive measures (e. g. , counseling), offer NJP, or recommend court-martial. Preferral of Charges: Formal accusation on a charge sheet if court-martial is pursued. Pre-Trial Confinement (Possible): Service member may be confined if flight risk or danger. Article 32 Hearing (General Court-Martial only): Preliminary hearing to review evidence and recommend disposition. Referral of Charges: Convening Authority decides to send charges to a specific type of court-martial. Pre-Trial Motions: Defense and prosecution file motions with the military judge (e. g. , to suppress evidence). Court-Martial Trial: Formal trial proceeds (voir dire, opening statements, presentation of evidence, closing arguments, findings). Sentencing (if convicted): Immediate phase where punishment is determined. Convening Authority Action/Clemency: Convening Authority reviews the case and may approve, disapprove, or reduce findings/sentence. Appellate Review: Cases with significant sentences are reviewed by military appellate courts (service-specific, then CAAF, rarely U. S. Supreme Court). Discharge Upgrades/Corrections Boards: Post-appeal avenues for modifying discharge characterization or correcting records (DRBs, BCMRs).

Common Myths & Mistakes About Military Justice Misconceptions about the UCMJ can lead to grave errors. Understanding these common myths is crucial for effective defense. Myth 1: "My commander will take care of me. " Reality: While your commander cares about your well-being, their primary duty is to maintain good order and discipline. They are not your legal counsel and are obligated to uphold military standards, which may conflict with your individual best interests. Myth 2: "NJP (Article 15) is always better than a court-martial. " Reality: NJP avoids a federal criminal conviction, but it uses a lower burden of proof, lacks many due process rights (like cross-examination), and can still severely damage your career (evaluations, promotion, re-enlistment, administrative separation). Sometimes, refusing NJP and demanding a court-martial offers a better chance at full exoneration or a more favorable outcome with full due process rights. Myth 3: "A positive drug test means I'm automatically guilty. " Reality: A positive urinalysis creates a strong inference of wrongful use, but it is not an automatic conviction. Defenses such as innocent ingestion, chain of custody violations, or lab errors can be highly effective. Myth 4: "Military lawyers are free, so they're the best option. " Reality: Military defense counsel are dedicated professionals, but they often have high caseloads and may lack the specialized, independent expertise of civilian military defense attorneys who are not beholden to the military chain of command and can focus solely on your case. Myth 5: "I should talk to investigators to clear my name. " Reality: This is one of the most dangerous mistakes. Invoking your Article 31b rights immediately and remaining silent until you've consulted a lawyer is paramount. Investigators are not there to help you; they are gathering

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) About the UCMJ Here are answers to common questions service members have about military justice. Q: What is the difference between military and civilian jurisdiction? A: Military jurisdiction under the UCMJ applies to service members worldwide for offenses both on and off base. Civilian jurisdiction applies to civilians within specific geographical boundaries. Sometimes, both military and civilian authorities may have jurisdiction over an offense. Q: Can I refuse a military drug test? A: Generally, no. Refusing a lawful order to provide a urine sample can itself be a UCMJ violation (e. g. , Article 92) with severe consequences, potentially even worse than a positive test. However, the sample collection itself must adhere to strict procedures, and your lawyer can challenge procedural violations. Q: What happens if I get a civilian DUI/DWI while in the military? A: A civilian DUI/DWI can lead to serious military action, including UCMJ charges (e. g. , Article 111 - Drunken or Reckless Operation of a Vehicle, or Article 134 - General Article), Non-Judicial Punishment (NJP), administrative separation, and impacts on your security clearance and driving privileges on base. Q: How long does a UCMJ case take? A: The timeline varies significantly based on the complexity of the case, the type of action (NJP vs. court-martial), and the investigative agency involved. NJP can be resolved in weeks, while a complex General Court-Martial can take many months or even over a year. Q: Can I lose my retirement benefits if convicted under the UCMJ? A: Yes. A punitive discharge (Bad-Conduct Discharge or Dishonorable Discharge) from a court-martial conviction will result in the loss of all military retirement pay and benefits. Administrative separations can also impact retirement eligibility if they force you out before vesting. Q: What is a "punitive discharge" and how is...

The Profound Impact of Military Justice Outcomes The outcome of any UCMJ action, from NJP to court-martial, carries far-reaching consequences that can define a service member's life long after their military service. These impacts affect critical areas including discharge characterization, career progression, and post-military civilian life. A. Discharge Characterization and Benefits Your discharge characterization (Honorable, General, Other Than Honorable, Bad-Conduct, Dishonorable) is paramount. A punitive discharge from a court-martial conviction (BCD, DD, Dismissal) will almost always result in the loss of all VA benefits, including education (GI Bill), healthcare, and disability compensation. An Other Than Honorable (OTH) discharge from an administrative separation also typically renders a service member ineligible for most VA benefits. B. Career Implications Adverse UCMJ actions can halt promotions, restrict assignments, and ultimately lead to involuntary separation. Punitive discharges permanently bar re-enlistment, and even administrative separations can make continued military service impossible. C. Civilian Life Impact A federal criminal record from a court-martial conviction (for SPCM or GCM) creates significant barriers to civilian employment, professional licensing, and can lead to mandated sex offender registration for certain offenses. Less than Honorable discharges also create employment challenges and can lead to security clearance revocation or denial, severely limiting career opportunities in various sectors.

Understanding Military Criminal Investigative Agencies: CID, NCIS, OSI, and CGIS For service members, the names CID, NCIS, OSI, and CGIS are often whispered with a mix of awe and apprehension. These are not merely acronyms; they represent the elite federal law enforcement agencies of the United States military branches, tasked with investigating serious felony-level crimes that impact military personnel, property, and national security. Unlike unit commanders or Military Police, these specialized organizations operate with a significant degree of independence, wielding vast investigative powers. Understanding the mission, jurisdiction, and investigative scope of each of these agencies is critical for any service member. Encountering a special agent from CID, NCIS, OSI, or CGIS is a serious event that demands immediate and informed action. This comprehensive guide will explain the roles of these vital military criminal investigative organizations (MCIOs) and, crucially, underscore why securing expert legal counsel from a firm like Gonzalez & Waddington the moment you are contacted is non-negotiable for protecting your rights and your future. I. What are Military Criminal Investigative Organizations (MCIOs)? Military Criminal Investigative Organizations (MCIOs) are the Department of Defense's (DoD) primary federal law enforcement agencies responsible for conducting felony criminal investigations. Each military branch has its own dedicated MCIO. Federal Law Enforcement Status: MCIO special agents are federally credentialed law enforcement officers with powers to investigate crimes, execute warrants, and make arrests, often operating worldwide. Independence: While part of their respective military departments, MCIOs typically report outside the traditional operational chain of command. This independence is designed to ensure impartiality in investigations, even when allegations involve high-ranking personnel. Primary Mission: Their core mission is to identify, investigate, and neutralize criminal threats to military personnel, property, and resources, thereby enhancing military readiness and ensuring justice within the armed forces. They collect evidence and present findings to military...

Hiring the Best Officer Boards of Inquiry (BOI) Lawyers: What Truly Distinguishes Elite Defense For a military officer, a Board of Inquiry (BOI) is not merely a formality; it is a direct threat to a career built on dedication, sacrifice, and leadership. Whether triggered by allegations of misconduct, substandard performance, or other administrative concerns, a BOI can lead to involuntary separation from service, a less-than-honorable discharge, and the loss of hard-earned benefits. The stakes are monumental, demanding nothing less than the absolute best legal defense. But what qualities truly define the elite lawyers equipped to defend officers facing such a pivotal challenge? Beyond general legal competence, the best Officer BOI Lawyers possess a unique blend of deep experience, specialized knowledge, and an unwavering commitment to personalized service. At Gonzalez & Waddington, we believe that an officer's future demands a defense that embodies these very distinctions. This article explores the critical attributes that set premier military defense counsel apart, guiding you in selecting the advocate who can best protect your distinguished career. I.

Navigating Complexity: Experienced BOI lawyers have seen virtually every type of allegation and defense strategy. They anticipate the prosecution's moves, identify subtle inconsistencies in evidence, and understand the internal dynamics of military boards. Strategic Acumen: Years of trial experience in both military courts-martial and administrative proceedings enable lawyers to craft sophisticated defense strategies. They know how to gather critical evidence, identify and prepare expert witnesses, and...

Hiring the Best Administrative Separation Board Lawyers: What to Look For For any service member facing an Administrative Separation Board (ASB), the stakes are incredibly high. An ASB is not merely a formality; it's a "mini-trial" that can determine the fate of your military career, your hard-earned benefits, and your future in civilian life. In this pivotal moment, the quality of your legal representation can be the difference between a favorable outcome and devastating consequences. Choosing the best Administrative Separation Board lawyer is paramount, and it requires looking beyond basic qualifications to find a defense attorney who embodies specific, critical attributes. At Gonzalez & Waddington, we understand the profound impact an ASB can have. Our commitment is to provide a defense that matches the gravity of the situation. This guide will illuminate the essential qualities and experience you should seek when entrusting your military career to an Administrative Separation Board lawyer, helping you identify the best possible advocate for your defense. I. Years of Experience as a Dedicated Defense Lawyer Experience is not just a buzzword in legal defense; it is the bedrock of effective representation, particularly in the nuanced world of military justice. For Administrative Separation Boards, years spent actively defending service members translate directly into a deeper understanding of the system, its players, and its unspoken rules. Mastery of Military Regulations: The Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and service-specific regulations governing administrative separations (like Army Regulation 635-200) are complex. An experienced lawyer has not just read these regulations; they have applied them in countless real-world scenarios, understanding their interpretation and application by commanders and boards. Understanding Board Dynamics: Administrative Separation Boards are comprised of military officers and senior enlisted members. An experienced defense lawyer understands the psychology of these boards, knowing how to present a defense that...

Hiring the Best Military Defense Lawyers: Your Guide to Unrivaled Expertise For service members facing an investigation, administrative action, or court-martial, the choice of a military defense lawyer is arguably the single most critical decision they will ever make. Unlike a civilian legal battle, military justice operates within a highly specialized ecosystem, governed by the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and unique military regulations, customs, and procedures. The stakes are astronomically high, impacting not just freedom, but also military careers, hard-earned benefits, security clearances, and entire civilian futures. Therefore, simply hiring "a lawyer" is not enough; you need to hire the best military defense lawyer – one whose qualifications and approach truly set them apart.

Firms like Gonzalez & Waddington embody these highest standards, offering the aggressive, expert, and personalized defense that every service member deserves. I. Why Specialized Military Defense is Non-Negotiable The military justice system is a world unto itself. Its unique characteristics demand legal representation that extends far beyond general criminal defense experience. A lawyer who does not intimately understand this specialized environment is ill-equipped to provide an effective defense. A. The Unique Nature of Military Justice The UCMJ and Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM): These are complex legal texts that govern military offenses, procedures, and punishments. They differ significantly from state or federal civilian codes. Distinct Procedures: Military investigations, pre-trial processes (like Article 32 hearings), court-martial procedures, and appellate avenues are all unique to the armed forces.

Hiring the Best Military Letter of Reprimand Rebuttal Lawyers: Protecting Your Career A Letter of Reprimand (LOR), and especially its more severe cousin, the General Officer Memorandum of Reprimand (GOMOR), might seem like a mere administrative slap on the wrist. However, underestimating the profound and lasting impact of these documents is a critical mistake. An LOR, particularly if filed permanently in your Official Military Personnel File (OMPF), can derail promotions, deny reenlistment, prevent desirable assignments, and even trigger involuntary administrative separation from the military. It is not just a blemish; it is a direct threat to your entire military career and future. Successfully rebutting an LOR or GOMOR requires more than just drafting a polite letter. It demands strategic insight, deep legal knowledge, and a compelling presentation that can persuade a commanding general to overturn a serious decision. When your career hangs in the balance, hiring anything less than the absolute best military letter of reprimand rebuttal lawyers is a gamble you cannot afford. At Gonzalez & Waddington, we embody the pinnacle of military defense, offering unparalleled expertise and a commitment to safeguarding your legacy. I. Understanding the Threat: The Impact of a Military Letter of Reprimand A Letter of Reprimand is a formal administrative censure issued by a command authority to address serious misconduct or a failure to meet military standards. While distinct from Non-Judicial Punishment (NJP/Article 15) or a court-martial, its consequences can be equally devastating, especially if it's a GOMOR. A. What is a Letter of Reprimand (LOR) or GOMOR? LOR: A written censure for misconduct that falls below expected military standards. It serves as official notice of disapproval and is typically issued by a commander in your chain of command.

UCMJ Rights Explained: Your Essential Guide to Military Justice Rights For every individual serving in the United States Armed Forces, understanding their rights under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) is not merely a legal detail; it is a foundational pillar of their career, their freedom, and their future. The military justice system, while designed to maintain discipline and readiness, operates uniquely, with its own set of rules and procedures that differ significantly from civilian law. Without a comprehensive understanding of these UCMJ rights, service members can inadvertently jeopardize their standing, their benefits, and their civilian prospects. From the moment suspicion arises to the final stages of appeal, every service member is afforded specific protections and opportunities to defend themselves. However, these rights are not always automatic; they must be known, understood, and proactively asserted. This comprehensive guide will illuminate the essential UCMJ rights that every service member possesses, explaining when and how they apply across investigations, non-judicial punishments, administrative separations, and courts-martial. At Gonzalez & Waddington, we firmly believe that an informed service member is a protected service member, and our mission is to provide the aggressive legal defense necessary to uphold these critical UCMJ rights. I. Foundational UCMJ Rights: The Cornerstone of Military Justice At the heart of the UCMJ lie fundamental rights designed to protect service members from overreach and ensure due process, even within the military's unique disciplinary framework. A. Article 31b UCMJ: The Right Against Self-Incrimination Article 31b of the UCMJ is the military equivalent of the civilian Miranda warning, and it is arguably the most critical right a service member possesses. It guarantees that: You have the right to remain silent. Any statement you make can be used against you in a court-martial or other disciplinary proceeding. You have the right to consult...

Its procedures, rules of evidence, and potential consequences demand a defense attorney with highly specialized knowledge and a proven track record within this specific arena. A court-martial is not merely a "military trial"; it is a federal criminal proceeding with global jurisdiction and lifelong ramifications. Unique Legal Landscape: The UCMJ, Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM), and service-specific regulations create an intricate web of laws that civilian attorneys unfamiliar with military justice cannot effectively navigate. Severe Consequences: A court-martial conviction can lead to punitive discharges (Bad-Conduct or Dishonorable), lengthy confinement, forfeiture of all pay and benefits, loss of security clearances, and a federal criminal record that follows you for life.

Do I Need a Military Defense Lawyer Near Me? Why Global Expertise Trumps Location When facing a military investigation, an Article 15, administrative separation, or a court-martial, your immediate instinct might be to search for "military defense lawyer near me. " This is a natural human reaction – to seek help that is readily accessible, geographically close, and seemingly convenient. However, when your military career, freedom, and future are on the line, the question of proximity becomes entirely secondary to the paramount need for unparalleled expertise. The truth is, the very best military defense lawyers do not operate within local confines; they travel worldwide. They possess a global reputation precisely because military law is a specialized, federal practice that transcends state and national borders. Hiring a local lawyer based solely on their physical location can be a critical mistake, unless they coincidentally happen to be a top-rated, seasoned trial lawyer who also possesses deep, specific expertise in military defense. This article will explain why military trial experience and a global reputation will always trump geographical location when your freedom and career are at stake. I. The Unique Nature of Military Law: Why "Local" Doesn't Apply Understanding why geographic proximity is irrelevant in military defense begins with grasping the fundamental differences between military law and civilian law. A. Federal, Not Local Practice The UCMJ is Federal Law: The Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) is a federal statute, passed by the U. S. Congress. It is not state law, nor does it vary from county to county. It applies uniformly to all service members, regardless of their physical location or state of residence.

What is a GOMOR and How to Fight It: Your Career Demands Aggressive Defense For service members, receiving a General Officer Memorandum of Reprimand (GOMOR) can feel like a sudden, devastating blow to their military career. Often presented as an administrative formality, a GOMOR is far more than just a letter; it is a serious administrative censure that, if filed permanently in your Official Military Personnel File (OMPF), can effectively end your career, block promotions, and jeopardize your ability to remain in the service. Underestimating its power is a critical mistake. A GOMOR signifies that a General Officer or General Court-Martial Convening Authority (GCMCA) believes you have engaged in serious misconduct or failed to meet military standards. While it is not a criminal conviction, the implications for your future are severe. This comprehensive guide will explain what a GOMOR is, detail its profound impact, and outline the aggressive defense strategies essential to fighting it. When your career hangs in the balance, immediate and expert legal intervention from a firm like Gonzalez & Waddington is not just advisable—it is absolutely essential. I. What is a General Officer Memorandum of Reprimand (GOMOR)? A GOMOR is a formal, written administrative reprimand issued by a General Officer or a General Court-Martial Convening Authority (GCMCA). It serves as an official censure for significant misconduct or substandard performance that, while serious, may not warrant a court-martial. It is a powerful tool commanders use to address behavior deemed inconsistent with military standards and values. A. Definition and Purpose The GOMOR is a formal document that officially records and criticizes a service member's alleged misconduct. Its purpose is to officially document serious lapses in conduct or performance, deter future misconduct, and ensure appropriate administrative action.

Article 128 UCMJ – Assault Charges in the Military What to Know If You're Accused of Assault Under the UCMJ What Is Article 128? Article 128 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) addresses a broad spectrum of assault-related offenses. It criminalizes everything from threats of violence and shoving someone to serious battery involving weapons or serious bodily injury. Even if the alleged victim wasn’t injured, you can still be convicted under this article if the prosecution can prove you attempted or threatened unlawful force. The military treats all types of violence—especially within units or during deployment—as serious threats to discipline, order, and morale. A single accusation of assault can lead to an investigation, confinement, court-martial, administrative separation, and loss of benefits. And depending on the facts, your case could quickly escalate from a minor scuffle to a felony-level prosecution. Types of Assault Under Article 128 Simple Assault: Attempt or offer with unlawful force or violence. No contact is necessary. Assault Consummated by Battery: Physical contact occurred—punch, grab, slap, etc. Aggravated Assault: Assault with a weapon or means likely to cause death or serious bodily harm. Assault on a Superior Commissioned Officer: A uniquely serious charge that can result in harsher punishment due to military hierarchy. Assault on a Sentinel or Guard: Protected status of the victim enhances the severity. Domestic Violence: When the assault involves a spouse, intimate partner, or family member. Penalties for Article 128 Violations Punishments vary based on the type of assault and other aggravating factors: Confinement (up to 10 years or more for aggravated cases) Dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge Reduction in rank and forfeiture of pay Loss of retirement, GI Bill, and VA benefits Even “minor” assault cases can result in separation from the military and a permanent mark on your record.

Court-Martial Defense Purpose: Your Authoritative Guide to Protecting Your Military Career and Future For any service member, the notification of a potential court-martial is a seismic event. It represents not just an accusation, but a direct threat to everything one has built: a military career, hard-earned benefits, reputation, and even freedom. In such moments of profound uncertainty, understanding the purpose of court-martial defense becomes paramount. It is not merely about responding to charges; it is about a multi-faceted, strategic fight for your entire future. Unlike civilian criminal proceedings, military justice operates under its own unique code – the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) – with distinct procedures, rules of evidence, and a hierarchy that can feel overwhelmingly stacked against the accused. This complexity means that effective defense demands specialized knowledge, relentless advocacy, and an unwavering commitment to protecting the service member's rights at every turn. This authoritative guide will delineate the comprehensive purpose of court-martial defense, from the earliest stages of investigation to potential post-conviction appeals. At Gonzalez & Waddington, we define our purpose by securing justice for those who serve, ensuring their rights are protected with an aggressive, battle-tested defense. I.

Administrative Separation Boards: Deep Dive into Boards of Inquiry (BOI) and Enlisted Elimination For any service member facing the threat of involuntary separation, understanding the mechanisms by which the military can end their career is paramount. This process is rarely as simple as being "fired. " Instead, it is governed by a complex set of administrative procedures, often culminating in an Administrative Separation Board (ASB) for enlisted personnel or a Board of Inquiry (BOI) for officers. These boards are not criminal trials, yet their outcomes can be just as, if not more, devastating to a service member's future, impacting everything from veteran benefits and civilian employment to personal reputation. This comprehensive guide delves deep into the purpose, intricate procedures, and strategic considerations of administrative separation boards, including Boards of Inquiry and the enlisted elimination process when no board is granted. A civilian military defense lawyer will explore why these boards exist, how they operate, the critical due process rights afforded to service members, and the powerful defense strategies required to safeguard your career.

The Core Purpose of Administrative Separation Boards: Maintaining Standards Administrative Separation Boards (ASBs) and Boards of Inquiry (BOIs) serve as the military's formal mechanism for involuntarily removing service members who, for various reasons, no longer meet the high standards required for continued service. Their fundamental purpose is to preserve the readiness, discipline, and integrity of the armed forces by separating individuals whose conduct, performance, or suitability falls below established military expectations. A. Beyond Punishment: A Focus on Suitability and Retention Unlike courts-martial, which are designed to punish criminal misconduct, ASBs and BOIs are administrative proceedings focused on...

Article 15 / Non-Judicial Punishment Should You Accept This Military Discipline For service members facing a disciplinary issue, an Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), commonly known as Non-Judicial Punishment (NJP), often seems like a straightforward and less severe alternative to a court-martial. It's frequently presented as a quick way to resolve minor misconduct and move forward. However, this apparent simplicity can be highly deceptive. Underestimating the true impact of an Article 15 can lead to hidden, severe consequences that profoundly affect a service member's career, financial stability, and future benefits. The decision to accept or refuse an Article 15 is one of the most critical choices a service member will make during their time in uniform. It is a complex strategic calculation that requires immediate and expert guidance. This comprehensive guide will dissect what an Article 15 entails, illuminate your fundamental rights, expose the often-overlooked collateral consequences, and provide insight into making this pivotal decision. Understanding the nuances of NJP is essential for every service member to protect their hard-earned career and future. I. What is Article 15 UCMJ (Non-Judicial Punishment - NJP)? Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice grants commanding officers the authority to impose punishment for minor offenses without the intervention of a court-martial. This power is designed to provide commanders with a swift and efficient means to address misconduct and maintain discipline within their units. A. Definition and Purpose NJP is a disciplinary action that allows a commander to determine guilt or innocence and impose punishment independently. It is explicitly "non-judicial," meaning it does not go through the formal court system and, on its own, does not result in a federal criminal conviction. It serves as an alternative to a court-martial for offenses deemed less severe, but still requiring...

Military Investigations: Your Guide to CID, NCIS, OSI, CGIS Investigations Being the subject of a military investigation can be one of the most stressful and career-altering events a service member will ever face. Regardless of the type—whether it's a criminal inquiry by CID, NCIS, or OSI, an administrative fact-finding mission under AR 15-6, or an Equal Opportunity (EO) investigation—each carries significant weight and unique implications. Understanding the purpose, process, and your rights during each type of investigation is paramount to protecting your military career, reputation, and future civilian prospects. Too often, service members underestimate the long-term impact of even seemingly minor investigations, or they fail to invoke their crucial rights, leading to devastating and irreversible consequences. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the most common types of military investigations, highlighting their distinctions, common pitfalls, and the non-negotiable need for immediate, expert legal counsel. At Gonzalez & Waddington, we stand ready to aggressively defend service members worldwide against any military investigation. I. Criminal Investigative Divisions (CDI): CID, NCIS, OSI, CGIS – When a Crime is Suspected When serious criminal misconduct is suspected within the ranks, the military's dedicated criminal investigative divisions take the lead. These are specialized law enforcement agencies with broad authority to investigate felonies and major UCMJ violations. A. What are CDIs? Their Role and Focus CDIs are the primary criminal investigative arms of each military branch, analogous to the FBI in the civilian world. They are responsible for investigating serious crimes that fall under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). CID (Army Criminal Investigation Division): Investigates felony-level crimes involving Army personnel. NCIS (Naval Criminal Investigative Service): Investigates felonies and national security crimes involving Navy and Marine Corps personnel.

Military Investigations: Protecting Your Career In the United States military, investigations are an inescapable reality. From criminal probes by specialized agencies to administrative inquiries into performance or conduct, service members are regularly subject to scrutiny. While some investigations are routine fact-finding missions, many carry profound implications, potentially leading to administrative actions, loss of career, or even criminal prosecution under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). The moment you become aware of any investigation—whether you are a suspect, a subject, or even just a witness—is the critical juncture to secure expert legal counsel. The type of investigation, the procedures followed, your rights, and the potential outcomes vary significantly. Misunderstanding these nuances can be catastrophic. This comprehensive guide will dissect the various types of military investigations, clarify their purposes and processes, outline your essential rights, and detail why immediate and aggressive legal defense from a firm like Gonzalez & Waddington is non-negotiable to protect your career and future. I. The Landscape of Military Investigations: More Than Just Criminal Accusations Military investigations serve diverse purposes, from uncovering criminal misconduct to assessing systemic failures. Understanding their fundamental distinctions is key to recognizing the specific risks and appropriate responses. A. Purpose of Military Investigations At their core, military investigations aim to: Maintain Good Order & Discipline: Enforce standards of conduct and accountability. Fact-Finding: Ascertain the truth behind incidents, allegations, or accidents. Identify Misconduct: Determine if UCMJ violations or policy breaches occurred. Inform Command Decisions: Provide commanders with information to take appropriate administrative, disciplinary, or corrective actions. Improve Operations: Identify systemic issues or lessons learned from incidents. B. Key Distinctions: Criminal vs. Administrative Investigations This is the most crucial distinction, dictating the rules of evidence, burden of proof, and potential outcomes: Criminal Investigations: Purpose: To determine if a specific criminal offense under the UCMJ has...

Article 120 UCMJ – Sex Offense Allegations: Your Aggressive Defense Starts Now Few accusations carry the immediate and devastating weight of a military sex offense allegation under Article 120 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). In the current military climate of "zero tolerance" and heightened public scrutiny, an accusation of rape, sexual assault, or any related sexual misconduct can instantly shatter a service member's career, obliterate their reputation, and jeopardize their freedom for life. Unlike other UCMJ offenses, sex offense allegations often trigger a swift and aggressive response from military investigators and prosecutors, sometimes operating under a public perception that the accused is guilty until proven innocent. For any service member facing Article 120 allegations, the stakes are unparalleled. A conviction almost invariably leads to a punitive discharge, lengthy confinement, forfeiture of all military benefits, and a mandatory, lifelong requirement to register as a sex offender under federal and state laws. This is not merely a legal battle; it is a fight for your identity, your future, and your connection to society. This comprehensive guide will illuminate the complexities of Article 120, detail the investigative and court-martial processes, expose the severe consequences, and, most importantly, outline the aggressive defense strategies vital to protecting your life. At Gonzalez & Waddington, we understand the unique pressures and devastating impacts of these charges, and we stand ready to provide the unwavering, battle-tested defense you urgently need. I. Understanding Article 120 UCMJ: What Constitutes a Sex Offense? Article 120 of the UCMJ is a complex and frequently amended statute that defines various sexual offenses within the military justice system. Its broad scope covers a spectrum of misconduct, from sexual contact to rape, with specific definitions and elements that the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt. A.

How to Survive a Military Administrative Separation Board: Your Blueprint for Defense For any service member, receiving notification of an impending Administrative Separation Board (ASB) hearing can trigger immense stress and uncertainty. While often described as "administrative," make no mistake: an ASB is a formal, high-stakes proceeding that can irrevocably alter your military career, your veteran benefits, and your future in civilian life. Unlike a Non-Judicial Punishment (NJP) or a court-martial, an ASB is designed to determine if you should be involuntarily separated from the military for reasons related to misconduct, performance, or other administrative grounds. A less than Honorable discharge can be as devastating as a criminal conviction, stripping away everything you've worked for. This comprehensive guide is your essential blueprint for understanding, preparing for, and ultimately surviving a military Administrative Separation Board. We will demystify the process, illuminate your fundamental rights, detail powerful defense strategies, and emphasize why securing immediate, expert legal counsel from a firm like Gonzalez & Waddington is not just advisable, but absolutely critical to protecting your career and future. Your proactive and aggressive defense begins now. I. Understanding the Administrative Separation Board (ASB): The Stakes Are High Before you can effectively defend against an ASB, you must fully grasp its nature, purpose, and the profound implications of its outcome. This is not a mere formality; it is a battle for your military legacy and civilian prospects. What is an Administrative Separation Board (ASB)? An Administrative Separation Board (ASB) is a formal hearing convened by the military to decide whether a service member should be involuntarily separated from service. It is a critical component of the military's administrative disciplinary framework. For officers, this proceeding is typically referred to as a Board of Inquiry (BOI). While it shares some procedural similarities with a court-martial, it is...

Command Investigations (CDI's & Army AR 15-6): Understanding the Process In the intricate ecosystem of military operations, maintaining discipline, ensuring accountability, and addressing incidents effectively are paramount. Beyond the formal criminal justice system of courts-martial, military commanders frequently rely on administrative investigations to gather facts, determine causes, and inform critical decisions. Among the most common and far-reaching of these are Command Directed Investigations (CDIs), which, in the U. S. Army, are primarily conducted under the authority of Army Regulation 15-6 (AR 15-6). While not criminal proceedings, findings from these investigations can have significant, and often career-altering, consequences for service members. Understanding the purpose, process, and potential impact of CDIs and AR 15-6 investigations is vital for any service member who may become involved, whether as a witness, a subject, or an individual whose actions are being scrutinized. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of these administrative inquiries, their distinction from criminal investigations, and the crucial rights and strategies for those navigating their complexities. I. What are Command Directed Investigations (CDIs) & Army AR 15-6 Investigations? Command Directed Investigations (CDIs) are administrative inquiries ordered by a commander or other competent authority to gather facts related to a specific incident, allegation, or issue. Their primary purpose is fact-finding and informing command decisions, rather than prosecuting criminal offenses. A. The Role of Army Regulation 15-6 (AR 15-6) In the U. S. Army, AR 15-6 is the foundational regulation governing formal and informal investigations. It provides detailed procedures for appointing investigating officers, defining the scope of inquiries, gathering evidence, documenting findings, and submitting recommendations. While AR 15-6 applies to the Army, other branches have similar regulations for their own administrative investigations (e. g. , Navy/Marine Corps - JAGMAN investigations, Air Force - AFI 90-201, Coast Guard - COMDTINST M5830. 1).

Non-Judicial Punishment: Fighting Article 15 Punishment to Protect Your Military Career For many service members, a notification of intent to impose Non-Judicial Punishment (NJP), commonly known as an Article 15 under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), seems like a straightforward, if unpleasant, disciplinary action. It is often presented as a quicker, less severe alternative to a court-martial, suggesting a path to avoid more serious consequences. However, this perception can be misleading. Underestimating the true impact of an Article 15, or failing to challenge it effectively, can lead to devastating hidden consequences that jeopardize a service member's career, financial stability, and future benefits. The decision to accept or refuse an Article 15 is one of the most critical choices a service member will face. It is a complex legal and strategic calculation that demands immediate, expert legal counsel. This comprehensive guide will dissect what an Article 15 entails, explore your fundamental rights, expose the often-overlooked collateral consequences, and arm you with the knowledge necessary to make an informed decision and fight for your future. An Article 15 is not just a disciplinary action; it is a pivotal moment that requires aggressive and insightful defense to protect everything you have worked for. What is Article 15 UCMJ (Non-Judicial Punishment - NJP)? Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) grants commanding officers the authority to impose punishment for minor offenses without the intervention of a court-martial. This disciplinary tool is designed for the swift and efficient disposition of misconduct, serving to maintain good order and discipline within military units. Definition and Purpose NJP allows commanders to address infractions quickly and informally. The commander typically acts as the investigator, accuser, and decision-maker regarding guilt or innocence and the appropriate punishment. It is distinct from a court-martial because it does...

Court-Martial Defense Strategies: Your Unwavering Guide to Military Criminal Defense For any service member accused of a Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) violation, facing a court-martial is a daunting prospect. Unlike civilian criminal proceedings, military justice operates under its own distinct rules, procedures, and potentially career-ending consequences. The stakes are astronomically high: your freedom, your military career, your veteran benefits, and your future civilian life all hang in the balance. In such a critical situation, a robust and expertly executed defense strategy is not just advantageous—it is absolutely essential. This comprehensive guide delves into the multifaceted world of court-martial defense strategies, from the crucial initial steps during an investigation to the intricacies of trial tactics and post-conviction appeals. We will illuminate the fundamental rights of service members, expose common pitfalls, and demonstrate how an aggressive, knowledgeable military defense attorney can be your most powerful ally in navigating this complex system. At Gonzalez & Waddington, we understand the unique pressures and devastating impacts of a court-martial, and we stand ready to fight relentlessly to protect your rights and secure the best possible outcome. I. Understanding the Court-Martial Landscape: Rules, Standards, and Stakes Before delving into specific defense strategies, it is crucial to grasp the fundamental characteristics of the military justice system, which set it apart from its civilian counterparts. A. Types of Courts-Martial: Severity and Jurisdiction The UCMJ provides for three types of courts-martial, each with different jurisdictions and maximum penalties: Summary Court-Martial (SCM): The least severe. For minor offenses, generally for enlisted personnel only. Presided over by a single commissioned officer. No right to a military defense lawyer during the hearing (though you can consult one). Limited punishments (e. g. , 1 month confinement, 2/3 pay for 1 month, reduction in rank). A conviction here does *not* constitute a...

Below is a general overview for offenses tried by General Court-Martial, which carry the most severe penalties.

What Triggers a Separation Board in the U. S. Military? Separation boards—also called Administrative Separation Boards or Boards of Inquiry (BOIs)—are serious proceedings that can end a military career. Whether you’re active duty, a reservist, or a family member trying to understand the process, this guide will explain what triggers a separation board, what to expect, and how to defend against it. Quick Summary Separation boards are triggered by misconduct, substandard performance, or loss of security clearance. Boards determine whether the service member should be retained or discharged—and if so, what type of discharge (Honorable, General, or OTH). The process is administrative, but outcomes carry major career, benefits, and reputation consequences. Representation by a civilian military defense lawyer can be a game-changer in defending your career. Table of Contents What Is a Separation Board? Top Reasons a Separation Board Is Triggered Types of Separation Boards Your Rights at a Separation Board Consequences of a Board Decision How to Defend Against Separation FAQs: People Also Ask Speak to a Military Separation Board Defense Lawyer 1. What Is a Military Separation Board? A separation board is an administrative hearing where a panel of officers evaluates whether a service member should be involuntarily discharged. The board reviews evidence, hears witnesses, and ultimately recommends: Whether misconduct or substandard performance occurred Whether retention or discharge is warranted The characterization of discharge (Honorable, General, or Other Than Honorable) Unlike a court-martial, separation boards are not criminal trials—but the consequences can be equally damaging. 2. What Triggers a Separation Board? Common triggers include: Misconduct: Article 15s, civilian criminal convictions, UCMJ violations (e. g. , Article 120, 128, 92) Substandard Duty Performance: Failing PT tests, poor evaluations, dereliction of duty Drug Abuse: Positive urinalysis or substantiated drug-related misconduct Loss of Security Clearance: Especially for jobs requiring Top Secret...

Military Investigations: Your Rights, Essential Strategy, and Common Pitfalls to Avoid For any service member, the moment you become aware you are under a military investigation is a pivotal and often terrifying experience. It signals the beginning of a process that can unravel your career, strip away your benefits, and fundamentally alter your future. Unlike civilian police investigations, military investigations operate within a unique hierarchical structure and under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), presenting distinct challenges and demanding specialized legal expertise. Too often, service members make critical mistakes in the early stages of an investigation due to a lack of understanding of their rights and the deceptive nature of the process. These errors, made long before any formal charges are preferred, can severely compromise a defense. This comprehensive guide will illuminate the types of military investigations, detail your non-negotiable rights, expose common pitfalls, and outline the proactive strategies essential to protecting everything you've worked for. At Gonzalez & Waddington, we understand the stakes are monumental, and our aggressive defense begins the moment you need us. I. Understanding the Nature of Military Investigations: Not "Just a Chat" A military investigation is rarely a neutral fact-finding mission aimed solely at uncovering the truth. Instead, it is an adversarial process where investigators are tasked with building a case, often against a specific suspect. Understanding this fundamental nature is the first step in protecting yourself. A. The Adversarial Nature: Investigators Are Not Your Allies Unlike a friendly conversation, any interaction with military investigators (or even your chain of command, if they suspect you of misconduct) is designed to gather information that can be used to prosecute you. Investigators are highly trained in interrogation techniques, including deception, rapport-building, and psychological tactics, all legally permissible to elicit confessions or incriminating statements. Believing that "telling...

Military Investigations: Defense Actions to Take Immediately The moment you become aware that you are the subject of a military investigation can be terrifying. It often begins subtly: a sudden summons to your commander’s office, an escort to a military law enforcement agency (CID, NCIS, OSI, CGIS), or even a seemingly innocent conversation with your chain of command that quickly turns accusatory. In these critical first hours and days, the actions you take—or fail to take—can irrevocably determine the trajectory of your military career, your freedom, and your entire future. Make no mistake: a military investigation is not a friendly inquiry. Investigators are not there to help you. Their singular mission is to gather evidence that can be used to prosecute you. Any misstep, any word spoken without counsel, any right unknowingly waived, can be used to build a case against you. This comprehensive guide details the non-negotiable, immediate defense actions you must take to protect yourself. At Gonzalez & Waddington, we understand that time is your most precious asset in these moments, and we are prepared to intervene immediately to safeguard your rights and your future. I. The Imminent Threat: Recognizing a Military Investigation Military investigations rarely begin with a formal announcement. Instead, they often unfold through subtle cues that, if recognized, can signal the urgent need for immediate defense action. Your ability to identify these warning signs is your first line of defense. A. Subtle Signs of an Investigation Be vigilant for these indicators that you may be the subject of a military investigation: Being "Read Your Rights" (Article 31b UCMJ): If anyone in your chain of command, or military law enforcement (CID, NCIS, OSI, CGIS), begins a conversation by advising you of your rights under Article 31b of the UCMJ, you are unequivocally a suspect in a...

Military Investigations: What to Do When You’re Being Investigated in the Military The sudden realization that you are under investigation by military authorities is a jarring and often terrifying experience. Unlike civilian investigations, military inquiries can swiftly escalate, carrying unique rules, procedures, and potentially devastating consequences for your career, benefits, and future. Whether you are approached by NCIS, CID, OSI, CGIS, or even your own chain of command, your immediate actions can profoundly impact the outcome of your case. This comprehensive guide is designed to empower service members with critical knowledge about military investigations, illuminate your absolute rights, and outline the essential steps to take to protect yourself. It will underscore why contacting an experienced military defense lawyer, like those at Gonzalez & Waddington, is not just recommended, but a non-negotiable step to safeguard your career and civilian life. Understanding the investigative process and acting decisively are your first and most vital lines of defense. I. The Crucial First Moments: Recognizing an Investigation and Protecting Your Rights The initial phase of a military investigation is often the most critical. What you say or do in these first moments can establish the trajectory of your entire case. Many service members mistakenly believe they must cooperate fully without counsel, inadvertently damaging their own defense. A. Subtle Signs You Are Under Investigation Military investigations don't always begin with formal charges or a dramatic arrest. Often, the signs are subtle, designed to elicit information before you fully grasp the gravity of the situation. Pay attention to these indicators: Questioning by Law Enforcement: You are approached or called in for an "interview" by NCIS, CID, OSI, or CGIS agents. They may present as friendly and merely "gathering facts. " Interviews by Your Chain of Command: Your commander or a senior NCO begins asking questions about...
