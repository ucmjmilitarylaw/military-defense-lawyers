## Timeline of a UCMJ Case: From Incident to Resolution

Understanding the chronological progression of a UCMJ case helps service members know what to expect and when to act.

01. **Incident/Allegation:** Misconduct or alleged offense occurs and is reported.
02. **Initial Investigation:** Chain of command or criminal investigative agencies (CID, NCIS, OSI) gather facts. [Service member should invoke Article 31b rights](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/investigations/military-investigations-your-rights-essential-strategy-and-common-pitfalls-to-avoid/ "Military Investigations: Your Rights, Essential Strategy, and Common Pitfalls to Avoid") if suspected.
03. **Commander’s Decision/Disposition:** Commander decides whether to take no action, issue non-punitive measures (e.g., counseling), offer NJP, or recommend court-martial.
04. **Preferral of Charges:** Formal [accusation on a charge sheet if court-martial](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/ucmj/article-128/ "Article 128 UCMJ – Assault Charges in the Military") is pursued.
05. **Pre-Trial Confinement (Possible):** Service member may be confined if flight risk or danger.
06. **Article 32 Hearing (General Court-Martial only):** Preliminary hearing to review evidence and recommend disposition.
07. **Referral of Charges:** Convening Authority decides to send charges to a specific [type of court-martial](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/court-martial/ "Court-Martial Defense").
08. **Pre-Trial Motions:** Defense and prosecution file motions with the military judge (e.g., to suppress evidence).
09. **Court-Martial Trial:** Formal trial proceeds (voir dire, opening statements, presentation of evidence, closing arguments, findings).
10. **Sentencing (if convicted):** Immediate phase where punishment is determined.
11. **Convening Authority Action/Clemency:** Convening Authority reviews the case and may approve, disapprove, or reduce findings/sentence.
12. **Appellate Review:** Cases with significant sentences are reviewed by military appellate courts (service-specific, then CAAF, rarely U.S. Supreme Court).
13. **Discharge Upgrades/Corrections Boards:** Post-appeal avenues for modifying discharge characterization or correcting records (DRBs, BCMRs).
