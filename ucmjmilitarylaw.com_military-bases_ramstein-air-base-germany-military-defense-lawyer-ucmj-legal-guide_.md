## A Brief History of Ramstein Air Base, Germany

## Common Legal Issues for Service Members at Ramstein Air Base, Germany

### Court-Martial Under the UCMJ

Soldiers at Ramstein Air Base, Germany face charges under:

- **Article 120** – Sexual Assault
- **Article 128b** – Domestic Violence
- **Article 92** – Failure to Obey
- **Article 133/134** – Misconduct

Do not talk to CID or command without a civilian defense lawyer. Your words will be used against you.

### Article 15 / NJP

Article 15s are often offered for minor misconduct but can derail your career. You may have the option to refuse NJP and request a court-martial. Make this decision carefully—with legal counsel.

### GOMORs

A General Officer Memorandum of Reprimand can be filed locally or permanently. A permanent GOMOR can destroy promotion chances and trigger separation. A well-written rebuttal may save your file—and your future.

### Administrative Separation & Boards

Enlisted soldiers may face a **Chapter Separation** while officers face a **Board of Inquiry (BOI)**. These boards determine your discharge characterization and your access to VA benefits, retirement, and more.

### Command-Directed Investigations (CDI)

Often triggered by SHARP/SAPR complaints, CDIs are administrative—but serious. You have the right to remain silent and the right to hire a civilian lawyer to protect your interests during and after the investigation.
