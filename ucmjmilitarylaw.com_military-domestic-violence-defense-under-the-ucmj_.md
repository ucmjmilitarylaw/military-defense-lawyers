## Understanding Domestic Violence Charges in the Military

Domestic violence in the military is prosecuted under multiple provisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), primarily **Article 128b – Domestic Violence**, enacted by the 2019 NDAA and updated in 2024 (Source: 10 U.S.C. § 928b).

These charges may also trigger other UCMJ articles like Article 128 (Assault), Article 134 ( [General Article](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/ucmj/articles-of-the-ucmj-offenses-at-a-glance/ "Articles of the UCMJ: Offenses at a Glance")), and Article 133 (Conduct Unbecoming, for officers).

## What Constitutes Military Domestic Violence?

- Physical assault of a spouse, intimate partner, or cohabitant
- Emotional or psychological abuse with intent to control or intimidate
- Damage to property during domestic disputes
- Stalking, strangulation, or [threats of harm (often added under Articles](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/investigations/military-investigations-your-rights-essential-strategy-and-common-pitfalls-to-avoid/ "Military Investigations: Your Rights, Essential Strategy, and Common Pitfalls to Avoid") 130 and 128b)

The law applies to both male and female service members, including same-sex partnerships, and can involve acts committed on or off base.

## Military vs Civilian Prosecution

While civilians face state or federal prosecution, military members may be prosecuted in court-martial, receive [non-judicial punishment](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/military-lawyer/ "Top Reasons to Hire a Military Lawyer for Your Legal Needs") (NJP), or be processed for administrative separation. In some cases, the [military may refer the case to civilian](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/ucmj-military-justice-101/ "UCMJ Military Justice 101") authorities or try both simultaneously under _dual sovereignty_.

## The Consequences of a Domestic Violence Conviction

[Service members convicted](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/ucmj/the-profound-impact-of-military-justice-outcomes/ "The Profound Impact of Military Justice Outcomes") under Article 128b face severe penalties:

- Dishonorable discharge
- [Loss of military retirement and benefits](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/ucmj/frequently-asked-questions-faq-about-the-ucmj/ "Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) About the UCMJ")
- Confinement (up to 5–10 years depending on aggravating factors)
- Firearm prohibition under the Lautenberg Amendment
- Mandatory registration as a domestic violence offender (in some states)

## How To Defend Against Domestic Violence Allegations in the Military

1. **Hire a** [Civilian Military Defense Attorney: JAG defense counsel](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/start-here/ "Are You Under Military Investigation or Facing Discharge?") are often overloaded and unable to give your case the time it needs.
2. [Challenge Uncorroborated Accusations: Many military](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/court-martial/ "Court-Martial Defense") domestic violence cases rely solely on the alleged victim’s statement. A skilled lawyer can expose inconsistencies, bias, and motive to fabricate.
3. **Secure Digital and Physical Evidence:** Text messages, photos, Ring camera footage, and call logs often tell a different story.
4. **Discredit Biased Investigations:** Many cases are investigated by [Family Advocacy Program](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/ucmj-sexual-assault/ "Understanding UCMJ Sexual Assault: What You Need to Know About Military Justice and Accountability") (FAP) or command-directed investigations lacking due process and neutrality.
5. **Prepare for Character Attacks:** Expect prosecutors to use past counseling statements or unrelated conduct to argue a pattern of abuse. A strategic defense can neutralize this.

## Why Are False or Exaggerated Claims So Common?

# ![Military Domestic Violence Defense Under the UCMJ military defense attorneys](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Military-Domestic-Violence-Defense-Under-the-UCMJ-military-defense-attorneys-1.webp)

[Military domestic violence](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/ucmj/article-128/ "Article 128 UCMJ – Assault Charges in the Military") allegations often arise in the context of:

- Child custody disputes
- Breakups or divorce proceedings
- Revenge for infidelity or control
- Alcohol-fueled arguments with no witnesses
- Command climate that presumes guilt

These cases are highly emotional and often lack physical evidence. This makes it vital to uncover motive and inconsistencies through cross-examination, expert testimony, and digital forensics.

## Mini FAQ

### Can I be convicted if there are no injuries?

Yes. Under Article 128b, physical injury is not required. Emotional harm or credible threats may suffice.

### What if the alleged victim wants to drop the charges?

In military law, the command—not the victim—decides whether to pursue [charges](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/ucmj/article-128/ "Article 128 UCMJ – Assault Charges in the Military"). The case may proceed regardless of retraction.

### Will I lose my weapons rights?

Yes. A conviction can trigger the Lautenberg Amendment, barring firearm possession for life.

## How To Respond If You’re Accused

1. Remain silent. Do not talk to command, FAP, or [law enforcement without a lawyer](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/ucmj-military-justice-101/ "UCMJ Military Justice 101").
2. Gather favorable character letters from supervisors and peers.
3. Preserve all messages, videos, and call logs.
4. Request a copy of the complaint and investigation.
5. Consult with a defense lawyer who handles [UCMJ domestic violence cases](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/ucmj/ "UCMJ Explained: Military Justice Overview").

## Command-Directed Investigations and FAP Reports

Many domestic violence [allegations begin with a Family](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/air-force-false-accusations/ "Overcoming Challenges: How to Navigate False Accusations in the Air Force") Advocacy Program (FAP) referral. These investigations are \*\*not\*\* neutral. They often rely on unchecked narratives, assume abuse occurred, and push for treatment—even if no crime was committed (Source: DoDI 6400.06, 2023).

## Article 32 Hearings: Your First Line of Defense

These preliminary hearings are your chance to expose weak evidence, biased investigations, and questionable witnesses. While non-binding, Article 32s can shape plea deals, dismissals, or refiling decisions.

## Administrative Separation vs Court-Martial

In some cases, commands opt for an \*\*administrative [separation board\*\* instead of court-martial](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/ucmj-military-justice-101/ "UCMJ Military Justice 101"). Although lower in formality, the consequences—loss of benefits, discharge characterization—can still be career-ending. You still need aggressive [legal defense and expert](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/ucmj/why-understanding-the-ucmj-demands-expert-legal-counsel/ "Why Understanding the UCMJ Demands Expert Legal Counsel") preparation.

## Sentencing Strategy in Domestic Violence Trials

Even if convicted, sentencing matters. The right witnesses, rehabilitation efforts, psychological evaluations, and trial strategy can reduce confinement, preserve benefits, or allow continued [service](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/military-lawyers/ "Top Reasons Why Hiring Military Lawyers is Essential for Service Members") in rare cases.
