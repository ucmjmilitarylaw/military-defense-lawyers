## The Profound Impact of Military Justice Outcomes

The outcome of any UCMJ action, from NJP to court-martial, carries far-reaching consequences that can define a service member’s life long after their military service. These impacts affect critical areas including discharge characterization, career progression, and post-military civilian life.

### A. Discharge Characterization and Benefits

Your discharge characterization (Honorable, General, Other Than Honorable, Bad-Conduct, Dishonorable) is paramount. A [punitive discharge](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/boards/ "Administrative Separation Boards") from a court-martial conviction (BCD, DD, Dismissal) will almost always result in the loss of all VA benefits, including education (GI Bill), healthcare, and disability compensation. An Other Than Honorable (OTH) [discharge from an administrative separation](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/ucmj/article-92/ "Article 92 UCMJ – Failure to Obey Orders or Regulations") also typically renders a service member ineligible for most VA benefits.

### B. Career Implications

Adverse UCMJ actions can halt promotions, restrict assignments, and ultimately lead to involuntary separation. Punitive discharges permanently bar re-enlistment, and even administrative separations can make continued military service impossible.

### C. Civilian Life Impact

A federal criminal record from a court-martial conviction (for SPCM or GCM) creates significant barriers to civilian employment, professional licensing, and can lead to mandated sex offender registration for certain offenses. Less than Honorable discharges also create employment challenges and can lead to security clearance revocation or denial, severely limiting career opportunities in various sectors.
