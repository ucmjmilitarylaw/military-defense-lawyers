## Frequently Asked Questions About Military Justice

### What is the UCMJ and who does it apply to?

The Uniform Code of [Military Justice (UCMJ](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/military-domestic-violence-defense-under-the-ucmj/ "Military Domestic Violence Defense Under the UCMJ")) is the federal law governing the conduct of all U.S. military personnel. It applies to active duty servicemembers, National Guard and Reserve members on active duty, cadets, midshipmen, and certain retired servicemembers.

### What is the difference between an Article 15 and a court-martial?

[An Article 15 (Non-Judicial Punishment](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/military-bases/texas-military-law/ "Military Law & UCMJ Defense Lawyers in Texas") or NJP) is a commander’s disciplinary action for minor offenses, which does not result in a federal criminal conviction. A court-martial is a formal military criminal trial, which does result in a federal criminal conviction if found guilty, and carries much more severe punishments like punitive discharges or confinement.

### Do I have a right to a lawyer if I’m under military investigation?

Yes, under Article 31b of the UCMJ, you have the right to [remain silent and the right to consult](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/military-bases/florida-military-law/ "Military Law & UCMJ Defense Lawyers in Florida") with a lawyer (military or civilian) before and during any questioning if you are suspected of an offense. It is crucial to invoke these rights immediately.

### How does a military discharge affect my VA benefits?

Your discharge characterization (Honorable, General, Other Than Honorable, Bad-Conduct, Dishonorable) directly impacts your eligibility for VA benefits like the GI Bill, healthcare, disability compensation, and home loans. Honorable discharges typically grant full access, while punitive or less-than-honorable administrative discharges can severely limit or eliminate eligibility.
