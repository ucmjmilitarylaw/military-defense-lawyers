## USAG Korea \| Military Legal Guide for Service Members

U.S. Army Garrison Korea (USAG Korea) supports thousands of Soldiers, Airmen, and DoD civilians across the Korean peninsula, including locations like Camp Humphreys, Camp Casey, Daegu, and Yongsan. Service members here face a unique [legal environment combining U.S. military law](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/military-bases/georgia-military-law/ "Military Law in Georgia: Guide to UCMJ Courts-Martial and Legal Defense") with South Korean jurisdiction.

## 1\. The UCMJ Follows You Abroad

Being stationed in Korea does not exempt you from the Uniform Code of [Military Justice (UCMJ](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/military-bases/florida-military-law/ "Military Law & UCMJ Defense Lawyers in Florida")). All active-duty service members fall under its authority regardless of where they‚Äôre assigned. Violations‚Äîwhether minor or serious‚Äîcan result in:

- Non-Judicial Punishment (Article 15)
- Summary, special, or general court-martial
- Administrative separation (Chapters 13/14)
- GOMORs or Letters of Reprimand
- Loss of rank, security clearance, or VA benefits

## 2\. Aggressive Command Action in Korea

USFK and Eighth Army command policies emphasize good order and discipline, especially under the watch of allied forces. As a result, commands in Korea often adopt ‚Äúzero tolerance‚Äù approaches for certain infractions. You may face separation, punishment, or reassignment faster than at stateside posts‚Äîsometimes within days of an incident.

## 3\. Common Offenses Investigated in Korea

- **Article 120 ‚Äì Sexual Assault:** Allegations are common after alcohol-related incidents in barracks or off-post housing.
- **Article 92 ‚Äì Violating Orders:** Includes curfews, off-limits establishments, and restrictions in local policies.
- **Article 128b ‚Äì Domestic Violence:** Involving spouses, dependents, or dual-military couples.
- **Fraternization:** Especially between NCOs and junior enlisted or with Korean nationals.
- **Alcohol Misconduct & Off-Duty Incidents:** Fights, DUIs, public indecency, or disorderly conduct in ‚ÄúVille‚Äù areas near bases.

## 4\. Risk of Host-Nation Prosecution

Under the U.S.‚ÄìROK Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), South Korea can prosecute U.S. personnel for crimes committed off post or involving Korean nationals. Even if cleared by command, you could still face charges in Korean court. Rights, evidence rules, and trial procedures differ significantly from those in the U.S. military system.

## 5\. Administrative Actions Are More Common Than Courts-Martial

Most service members in Korea facing legal trouble aren‚Äôt court-martialed‚Äîthey‚Äôre administratively punished. This can happen quickly and leave permanent marks on your military record:

- GOMOR (General Officer Memorandum of Reprimand)
- Flagging actions and barred reenlistment
- Involuntary separation under Chapters 13 or 14
- Denied PCS or retention due to loss of clearance

## 6\. What to Do If You‚Äôre Under Investigation

- Do not speak to CID, MPI, Korean National Police, or command without first consulting an attorney.
- Assert your **Article 31(b)** rights immediately.
- You may be entitled to military counsel‚Äîbut you can also retain civilian military defense counsel familiar with Korea-based procedures.

## 7\. Know the Command Climate

Korean-based commands tend to prioritize swift action to maintain good host-nation relations. This often leads to overcharging, rushed NJPs, or command-directed investigations with limited due process. Soldiers must be prepared to defend themselves quickly and thoroughly.

## Common Legal Issues for Service Members at USAG Yongsan, Korea

### Court-Martial Under the UCMJ

Soldiers at USAG Yongsan, Korea face charges under:

- **Article 120** ‚Äì Sexual Assault
- **Article 128b** ‚Äì Domestic Violence
- **Article 92** ‚Äì Failure to Obey
- **Article 133/134** ‚Äì Misconduct

Do not talk to CID or command without a civilian defense lawyer. Your words will be used against you.

### Article 15 / NJP

Article 15s are often offered for minor misconduct but can derail your career. You may have the option to refuse NJP and request a court-martial. Make this decision carefully‚Äîwith legal counsel.

### GOMORs

A General Officer Memorandum of Reprimand can be filed locally or permanently. A permanent GOMOR can destroy promotion chances and trigger separation. A well-written rebuttal may save your file‚Äîand your future.

### Administrative Separation & Boards

Enlisted soldiers may face a **Chapter Separation** while officers face a **Board of Inquiry (BOI)**. These boards determine your discharge characterization and your access to VA benefits, retirement, and more.

### Command-Directed Investigations (CDI)

Often triggered by SHARP/SAPR complaints, CDIs are administrative‚Äîbut serious. You have the right to remain silent and the right to hire a civilian lawyer to protect your interests during and after the investigation.
