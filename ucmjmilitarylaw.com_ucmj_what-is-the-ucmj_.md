## What is the UCMJ?

The Uniform Code of Military Justice is a federal statute, enacted by the United States Congress, that establishes criminal law for military personnel. It applies to all active duty service members, National Guard and Reserve members on active duty orders, cadets and midshipmen, and in some cases, retired service members receiving pay. Unlike civilian law, which varies by state, the UCMJ provides a consistent legal standard across the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, ensuring uniformity in military justice wherever service members are stationed worldwide.

The primary purpose of the UCMJ is to maintain good [order and discipline](https://ucmjmilitarylaw.com/ucmj/article-134/ "Article 134 UCMJ – The General Article") within the armed forces, essential for military readiness and the effective execution of missions. It defines specific offenses that are unique to the military (e.g., Absence Without Leave) as well as those that parallel civilian crimes (e.g., assault, larceny).
